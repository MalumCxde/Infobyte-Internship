      <h3>Event Details: UFC 300</h3>
      <p>A UFC Light Heavyweight Championship bout between current champion Alex Pereira (also former UFC Middleweight Champion and former Glory Middleweight and Light Heavyweight Champion) and former champion Jamahal Hill will headline the event. The fight was verbally agreed for UFC 301 three weeks later, but the promotion opted to book it at this card. Pereira won the vacant title at UFC 295 against former champion Jiří Procházka after Hill was forced to vacate it in July 2023 due to a ruptured Achilles tendon.</p>

      <p>A UFC Women's Strawweight Championship bout between current two-time champion Zhang Weili and Yan Xiaonan is expected to take place at the event. It will mark the first time two Chinese-born athletes will meet for a title in the organization.</p>

      <p>Former interim UFC Lightweight Champion Justin Gaethje (also former WSOF Lightweight Champion) is expected to defend his symbolic "BMF" (baddest motherfucker) title against former UFC Featherweight Champion Max Holloway in a lightweight bout. Gaethje won the symbolic title at UFC 291 defeating fellow former interim champion Dustin Poirier by second round knockout in what was their second meeting.</p>

      <p>Former UFC Lightweight Champion Charles Oliveira and Arman Tsarukyan are scheduled to meet in a lightweight title eliminator bout.</p>

      <p>The main card will be opened by a middleweight bout between three-time NCAA Division I National Wrestling Champion and undefeated prospect Bo Nickal and Cody Brundage.</p>
